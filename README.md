By Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf <ibrauf@umich.edu>

A school project from my Computer Science I course. The user inputs a list of words into an input file and the program prints the length of each word and the number of words within the file onto the console.

What I learned
-------------------------
- How to use <fstream>
- How to read from an input file
- How to utilize string functions
